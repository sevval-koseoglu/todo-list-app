# Experience

## Tool Selection Justification:
I chose Cursor because it is simple and easy to use. It works inside Visual Studio Code, so I did not need to learn a new editor. This made the project easier to start and saved time. 

Cursor was appealing for this project because it can generate code by understanding simple instructions. For a Todo List App, this was useful because I could describe what I wanted and get working code quickly.

## Development Process:
I used Cursor during the whole development process. I asked it to create the basic structure of the Todo List App and then add features step by step. I mostly used short and clear prompts such as creating a todo list, adding new todos, and deleting todos. 

The best prompts were direct and simple. When the output was not correct, I changed the prompt or asked Cursor to fix the code. It usually took 3 or 4 tries to get code that worked correctly.

## Challenges and Solutions:
One challenge was that some code did not work exactly as I wanted. Sometimes the logic was missing or there were small errors in the code. I had to read the code and understand what was wrong.  

Cursor helped by suggesting new code when I explained the problem again. However, I still needed to fix some parts manually, such as small bugs and variable names.

## Reflection:
I was surprised by how fast the application was created using vibe coding. Writing less code manually made the development process faster and less stressful.  

This tool changed my workflow by letting me focus more on ideas instead of code details. I would use Cursor again for future projects because it is helpful for small applications. I think this technology will make software development easier for students and beginners.
